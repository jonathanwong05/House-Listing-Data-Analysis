          <p>This scatter plot displays the relationship between a property's total amenities (measured by the combined number 
            of bedrooms and bathrooms) and its listed price. Each point represents an individual listing, demonstrating possible 
            trends of how prices scale with increasing amenities. In general, there is a positive correlation: homes with more 
            amenities tend to have higher prices. However, the relationship is not strictly linear. Some properties with the 
            same number of amenities show wide price differences, suggesting that other factors, such as location, lot size, 
            or interior features, could potentially play a significant roles in the listed pricings. Furthermore, this scatter 
            plot helps in identifying clusters of typical homes (e.g., 3–4 total amenities priced between $200,000–$700,000), as 
            well as higher-priced outliers with fewer amenities, which are likely to reflect the premium locations of the listings 
            and the luxury design of the properties. Overall, this plot is useful for exploring and identitfying pricing patterns 
            across the market and highlighting where buyers may be paying more for location or design rather than just size or
            utility.</p>
