          <p>The scatter plot shows us how property lot sizes relate to listing prices across different states. By
            removing the extreme values (the highest and lowest 1% of both lot sizes and prices), we can focus on
            typical properties in the market. We can see that larger lots tend to have higher prices, but this pattern
            isn't consistent everywhere. Properties with the same amount of land can have very different prices, which
            tells us that other factors like location, house features, and amenities also play important roles in
            determining value.
            The graph uses a logarithmic scale for prices, which helps us see both affordable properties (around
            $10,000) and luxury homes (over $3 million) in the same view. Most properties in the data have less than 10
            acres of land and are priced under $1 million. The color coding by state reveals interesting differences in
            regional markets, with some states showing unique pricing patterns. This visualization is useful for both
            buyers who want to understand how much they might pay for certain lot sizes and for sellers who want to
            compare their property to similar-sized ones on the market.
