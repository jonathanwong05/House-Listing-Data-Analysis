        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>
          The US housing market provides important signals about economic conditions, regional development, and investment potential.
          This project examines house listings from across the United States to understand how property features affect pricing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We focus on key aspects like bedroom count, bathroom count, house size, and lot size to determine their relationship with listing prices.
          Our analysis also identifies how these relationships vary by location.
          The findings from this work will help homebuyers, real estate professionals, and researchers make better-informed decisions about housing.
        </p>

        <h2>Introduction to the Data</h2>
        <p>
          The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle under the title United States House Listings: Zillow Extract 2023 and contains over 22,000 records of house listings from across the United States (around 500 listings per state).
          Below is a sample of the dataset showing the first few records:

          Although the dataset is pre-cleaned, additional filtering and processing have been applied to tailor the data for our analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recent studies further highlight the purpose of our analysis. Feng et al. demonstrate that the relationship between size of property and price is non-linear; 
          bigger properties tend to price exponentially higher due to its luxury appeal (Feng et al., 2021). Additionally, Heyman and Sommervoll emphasize how relative 
          locations within a city could significantly influence price, with properties near transit, green space, and services resulting in higher values (Heyman and 
          Sommervoll, 2019). While these studies provide strong foundations, they  focus on localized markets or specific individual features. Our project expands on 
          this by analyzing a broader, nationwide dataset and integrating multiple property features, such as amenities, size, and location, into one comprehensive view. 
          With this approach, our analysis will uncover broader patterns across regions, helping buyers, sellers, and policymakers better understand how different factors 
          interact to shape propety values and price across the United States.
